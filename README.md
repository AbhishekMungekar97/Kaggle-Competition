## Kaggle-Competition-(Fashion-MNIST)
### - In this repository, we will be exploring my two different approaches towards a Kaggle competition
### - The first one involves step by step procedure of opting for the best machine learning model, amongst the several algorithms such as KNN, SVM, DTC, random forests and Gradient boosting trees.
### - In the second one, Deep neural network based approaches have been used. These include a Simple CNN architecture, followed by the pouplar AlexNet model and lastly, the INCEPTION V4 model.
